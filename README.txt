Alena Malyarenko and Alexandra Gossart - October 2022


This folder contains the file required to set up the Polar version of the Scripps-Kaust model.
The user must install the SKRIPS model following the steps listed here: https://github.com/iurnus/scripps_kaust_model and https://skrips.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2/esmf/index.html

Then, the user is required to link or copy the files in the MITgcm, the PWRF and the coupler folder to the corresponding folders in the original installation of the model (see the install.sh script).

Information on this coupled model can be found in the paper that will be submitted to Geosciences Model Developments : 
Malyarenko, A., Gossart, A., Sun, R. and Krapp, M.: Conservation of heat and mass in P-SKRIPS: the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model of the Ross Sea.
